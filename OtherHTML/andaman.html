                <h3>About Andaman & Nicobar Islands</h3><br>
                <p>The history of the Andaman and Nicobar Starts from the Ramayana period.In the Ramayana period it was
                    called as Handuman, As time passes away this place was renamed. In the 1st Century this place was
                    called as Agadaemon Angademan according to Ptolemy. Travellers from different parts of the world
                    visited this place. Arab Travellers visited on 19th Century, Marco Polo visited in 13 th century who
                    describes this place as Angamanian, Friar Odoric in 14th Century, Caesar Fredericke in 16th Century.
                    In the 17th century Lieutenant Archibald Blair of the Royal Indian Navy founded a naval base on a
                    small island adjoining south Andaman merely by clearing forests, setting up cottages, and planting
                    kitchen gardens and orchards. Even so, the base marked the arrival of civilization, of human control
                    over the vegetative wild.</p>
                <p>
                    The first colony was set up in chatham island with 12 acres of land.In 1857 “The Andaman Committee”
                    under Dr. Frederic John Mouat was set up to examine best site for penal settlement. Captain H Man
                    raised Union Jack at Port Blair on 22 January 1858 (2nd time) to establish and manage Penal System.
                    In the spring of 1858 the British Government in India started a penal settlement at South Andaman,
                    at the same harbour (Chatham) where the first colony had stood almost a century earlier. It was
                    named Port Blair. The Britishers forced the prisoners to clear the jungle, which disturbed the
                    natives, The natives began to hit back. This brings up the spark among the natives to fight against
                    the Britishers for their freedom, which led the first war called “The Battle of Aberdeen” in 17th
                    May 1859). </p>
                <p>
                    Construction of the Cellular Jail was took place between 1896 and 1910 with a total of 668 cells
                    having 7 wings in Star circular model. This jail was built to Imprison the freedom fighters from the
                    mainland. Japanese occupation of Port Blair took place during the Second World War(1942 to 1945).
                    Provisional Indian Government Under Subhas Chandra Bose was established in 1943. After Independence
                    the Indian Government setup the administration in these islands making Port Blair as the Head
                    Quarter. The First Chief Commissioner of Independent Andaman was Shri Imam-ul-Majid in 1947. First
                    Batch of Settlers during Post Independence Era: Rehabilitation of about 198 refugee families from
                    Pakistan(March 1949). After that the Settlement continued in 1950,1951,1952………1961. These
                    Settlers are Basically Agriculturists and Petty tradesmen from Bengal, Ranchi, Kerala, Tamil Nadu,
                    etc. The Government has offered Land for those Settlers.</p>
                <p>
                    Presently, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, union territory, India, consists of two groups of
                    islands at the southeastern edge of the Bay of Bengal. The peaks of a submerged mountain range, the
                    Andaman Islands and their neighbours to the south, the Nicobar Islands, form an arc stretching
                    southward for some 620 miles (1,000 km) between Myanmar (Burma) and the island of Sumatra,
                    Indonesia. The arc constitutes the boundary between the Bay of Bengal to the west and the Andaman
                    Sea to the east. Port Blair (on South Andaman Island) is the territorial capital.</p>
                <p>
                    The Andamans comprise more than 300 islands. North, Middle, and South Andaman, known collectively as
                    Great Andaman, are the main islands; others include Landfall Island, Interview Island, the Sentinel
                    Islands, Ritchie’s Archipelago, and Rutland Island. Little Andaman in the south is separated from
                    the Nicobar Islands by the Ten Degree Channel, which is about 90 miles (145 km) wide. The Nicobars
                    consist of 19 islands. Among the most prominent are Car Nicobar in the north; Camorta, Katchall, and
                    Nancowry in the centre of the chain; and Great Nicobar in the south. About 90 miles to the southwest
                    of Great Nicobar lies the northwestern tip of Sumatra, Indonesia.
