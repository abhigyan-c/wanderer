        <h3>About Kurseong</h3><br>
        <p>Kurseong is a hill station (as well as a sub-divisional town) in West Bengal's Darjeeling District. Kurseong,
          at an elevation of 1458 metres (4864 feet), is only 30 kilometres from Darjeeling. It enjoys a lovely
          environment all year, and the winters are not as harsh as those in Darjeeling. Kurseong is known locally as
          "Kharsang," which means "Land of White Orchids" in Lepcha. Kurseong is around 47 kilometres from Siliguri and
          is accessible by road and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. Bagdogra is the nearest airport.</p>
        <p>
          The nearest major train station to the Land of the White Orchids is New Jalpaiguri (NJP), which is about 53
          kilometres from Kurseong. The town's economy is built on education and tourism. The months of March and May,
          as well as the months of August and October, are ideal for visiting Kurseong. In 1835, the Chogyal (Monarch)
          of Sikkin Kurseong surrendered to the British Empire. Later in 1880, the colonial government turned this small
          hamlet into a tourist destination, and it became a popular location for sanatoriums where the ill could
          rehabilitate. </p>

                  The Morgan House was made especially to celebrate the wedding of Mr. George Morgan, a jute baron, with
                  a lady who was an indigo plantation owner. After the wedding, Mr and Mrs Morgan occupied the British
                  colonial mansion, spread across 16 acres of land on the Durpindara Mountain. It was their summer home
                  for a long time. As an added bonus, the house overlooking the majestic Kanchenjunga mountain range,
                  proved to be the perfect place to start a new life post marriage. But, the happiness did not last lost
                  for the Morgans. It so happened that Mrs. Morgan died a premature death, and Mr. Morgan left the house
                  soon after. A trust took the ownership of the house after its abandonment and after India attained
                  Independence the government took control of the property. It is now being maintained as a boutique
                  hotel. Going to the mystery behind Mrs. Morgan’s sudden demise, it is believed that her husband
                  tortured her before she died, and hence, her unhappy soul still haunts the house. Although, there have
                  been no sightings of Mrs. Morgan’s ghost, but people have heard tapping of high-heeled footwear in the
                  corridors of the lodge.
