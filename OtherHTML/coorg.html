        <h3>About Coorg</h3><br>
        <p>Wake up to the aroma of soothing coffee and take in the picturesque grandeur of this misty land of hills and
          streams. Coorg, often known as the Scotland of India, lives true to its reputation with an enticing blend of
          history, elegance, adventure, and delectable cuisine. This well-known coffee-producing hill station, located
          along the western ghats, is well-known for its jaw-dropping beautiful scenery and wealth.

          This misty landscape has a rich culture and a unique indigenous clan - Kodavas who specialise in martial arts
          and are well-known for their hospitality. From admiring the beauty of this magnificent destination to a tough
          hike or a deep insight into the culture at the Madikeri Fort to the thrilling experience at Abbey falls. Coorg
          will make you oscillate to the extremes in everything, from heart-melting handmade truffles to sweet
          heart-melting handmade truffles. </p>
        <p>
          With so many activities available in the house, this is a great place for everyone, whether you are a foodie,
          an explorer, an adventurer, or a seeker of tranquillity. Not to mention the well-known festivals of Keil Poldu
          (worship of weapons), Cauvery Shankaramana (return of the river goddess), and Huttari (harvest).

          With stunning mountains, a cascade of tumbling streams, and a feast for the eyes of flora and wildlife, this
          place is a must-see for everyone looking for a break from their boring 9-5 stressful existence. Coorg is
          well-known for being the favoured place for hiking and white water rafting, making it an ideal location for
          thrill-seekers.</p>
        <p>
          In the winter afternoons, drive around the misty roads around the hills to quench your appetite for adventure.
          Though the touch of excitement is enough to pique your interest, remember to take precautions while on your
          adventurous journey to Coorg.

        <h3 id="a3">Day 1 </h3>

        <h5>Arrival at Coorg </h5>
        Located just about two seventy kilometres away from the city of Bangalore, Coorg is easily accessible to the
        tourists. You'll be escorted from the Bangalore station/airport and after a 5-6 hour journey, we'll reach the
        resort at Coorg. Dinner at the hotel.<br>

        <h3 id="a3">Day 2 </h3>

        <h5>Visit Kushalnagar and Namdroling Monastery</h5>

        After breakfast, we'll head out for Kushalnagar around 10 in the morning. Coorg has rich cultures, apart from
        the local cultures they give equal respect to foreign culture as well. There’s a town called Bylakuppe (5KM from
        Kushalnagar and 35 KM from the main town of Madikeri), a hub for Tibetans. And here you’ll find the famous
        Namdroling Monastery, also known as The Golden Temple. Bylakuppe is the largest settlement of Tibetans in India
        after Dharmashala and the largest teaching center of Nyingmapa, a lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. This Monastery is
        also home for around 6000 monks who’re peacefully living here. Take a stroll around the Monastery and get ready
        to explore the market and food joints nearby. Though ‘Kushalnagar,’ is comparatively much smaller than Madikeri,
        it makes for an amazing place for tourists to explore. Back at the hotel by evening. Dinner at the resort.
        <br>

        <h3 id="a3">Day 3</h3>

        <h5>Explore Nisargadhama and Dubare Elephant Camp</h5>
        Breakfast(complimentary) at the resort. Set out for the next adventure at 10 am in the morning for Dubare
        Elephant Camp.This camp has been started when woodcutting and logging operations were banned by the Government.
        There are around 100 elephants in the camp, and they are now being taken care of by people hired by the
        Government. Dubare Elephant Camp is a perfect place to experience the life of elephants. Here you can spend time
        with elephants, can feed them, get down in the river Cauvery to watch elephants taking bathe in the river (They
        charge 2 USD per person to get into the river with elephants). Lunch at 2 in a nearby restaurant. Then we set
        out for Nisargadhama. One can find a number of children playing in the arena and also within the adventure park,
        located within the premises. This forest resort makes for a great place for those of you looking for a relaxed
        and laid back, place to camp during your Coorg trip. We'll visit Chiklihole Reservoir on our way back. This
        amazing view point is not one to be missed out, and we reach here just before sunset to enjoy the fascinating
        scenes of nature. Return to the hotel by 7. Snacks and dinner at the resort.
        <br>

        <h3 id="a3">Day 4</h3>

        <h5>Get enchanted at Madikeri, Talacauvery, Omkareshwar, Raja's Seat and Abbey Falls</h5>

        After an overnight stay at the resort, tourists can make their way towards the region of ‘Madikeri.’ Located
        just about thirty kilometres away from the resort, is a region that is filled with extensive mists, rains and
        serene environment, unlike any other. The lush greenery of the lands and the stunning landscape that comes along
        with it, make ‘Madikeri,’ an ideal destination for your Coorg itinerary. Then we head for Omkareshwar temple.
        Omkarhswar temple is dedicated to Lord of Shiva of Hindu mythology. It is famous for its Gothic and Islamic mix
        of architecture. Temple is situated in the center of the main town. (** taking pictures inside the temple isn't
        allowed **). From Omkareshwar Temple head towards Talacauvery, which is the origin point of river Cauvery. On
        the way to Talacauvery have lunch at South Indian restaurant, there are many of them. It will take around an
        hour to Talacauvery. On reaching Talacauvery you will find a huge arch at the gate amidst the Brahmagiri hills.
        Talacauvery is famous for two things, firstly for the temple dedicated to Kaveriamma (Mother Cauvery) and
        secondly for the majestic views of the Brahmagiri hills. At 4, we head towards Abbey Falls. When it comes to the
        most picturesque and unique waterfalls in the hills, the ‘Abbey Falls,’ has got to be it. Located about seven
        kilometres into the stunning landscapes of the region, the waterfalls has got to be a must-do on your Coorg
        trip. This is undoubtedly one of the most popular attractions for tourists in Coorg. On our way back we reach
        Raja's seat and ‘Coorg Valley Viewpoint’. These two amazing viewpoints are not worth missing when you come to
        Coorg, and their majestic beauty can be enjoyed especially at sunset, around 6:00 pm. Return to the hotel by
        7:30pm. Snacks and dinner at the resort.
        <br>

        <h3 id="a3">Day 5</h3>

        <h5>Trekking- Tadiandamol & Mandalpatti</h5>
        We start in the morning at around 8:30 am. Coorg houses few of the Karnataka’s highest peaks. The scenic beauty
        of Coorg makes trekking a good idea. Mandalpatti and Tadiandamol are two of the best options. Tadiandamol is
        Karnatak’s 3rd highest peak, standing 1748 meters high, and is very popular among the trekkers. This trek is 12
        KM long, to and fro distance from the base point. Trek starts at the base of the hill at Nalkanad Palace. The
        terrains are quite steep right from the beginning so brace yourself to take on the challenge.Weather changes
        drastically during the trek, at one point it will be raining while at others it will get all sunny. Do carry
        your sunglasses, raincoat and a cap to cover yourself as per the weather conditions. Pack light in a small
        backpack, it will be difficult to climb otherwise. After covering some 3KM you would reach the Shola Forest
        checkpoint. They charge 2 USD per person as a fee to enter the forest area. <br>
