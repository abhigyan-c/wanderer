        <h3>About Coorg</h3><br>
        <p>Wake up to the aroma of soothing coffee and take in the picturesque grandeur of this misty land of hills and streams. Coorg, often known as the Scotland of India, lives true to its reputation with an enticing blend of history, elegance, adventure, and delectable cuisine. This well-known coffee-producing hill station, located along the western ghats, is well-known for its jaw-dropping beautiful scenery and wealth.

        This misty landscape has a rich culture and a unique indigenous clan - Kodavas who specialise in martial arts and are well-known for their hospitality. From admiring the beauty of this magnificent destination to a tough hike or a deep insight into the culture at the Madikeri Fort to the thrilling experience at Abbey falls. Coorg will make you oscillate to the extremes in everything, from heart-melting handmade truffles to sweet heart-melting handmade truffles. </p>
        <p>
          With so many activities available in the house, this is a great place for everyone, whether you are a foodie, an explorer, an adventurer, or a seeker of tranquillity. Not to mention the well-known festivals of Keil Poldu (worship of weapons), Cauvery Shankaramana (return of the river goddess), and Huttari (harvest).
          
          With stunning mountains, a cascade of tumbling streams, and a feast for the eyes of flora and wildlife, this place is a must-see for everyone looking for a break from their boring 9-5 stressful existence. Coorg is well-known for being the favoured place for hiking and white water rafting, making it an ideal location for thrill-seekers.</p>
          <p>
          In the winter afternoons, drive around the misty roads around the hills to quench your appetite for adventure. Though the touch of excitement is enough to pique your interest, remember to take precautions while on your adventurous journey to Coorg.
